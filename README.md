# Enquirix 📋
**A Personal Deep-Dive into the MERN Stack**

Enquirix is a project I started to challenge myself with full-stack development. While the core idea is a **Data Entry & Storage Tool**, the real goal was to master how data flows between a React frontend and a MongoDB database.

### 💡 Why Enquirix?
I wanted to move beyond simple "To-Do" apps and build something that handles structured data. I chose **Flowbite** for the UI because I wanted to experiment with clean, accordion-style layouts to manage information without cluttering the screen.

### 🛠️ What I'm working on:
* **MERN Integration:** Connecting the dots between Node.js, Express, and React.
* **UI/UX with Flowbite:** Using accordions and custom components to make data entry feel less like a chore and more like a smooth experience.
* **Clean Code:** Learning how to organize folders and manage state efficiently.

### 🏗️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Flowbite (for those nice UI components)
* **Backend:** Node.js & Express
* **Database:** MongoDB

### 📈 Current Progress
I'm currently in the middle of building this! 
- [x] Basic project setup and folder structure.
- [x] Frontend UI design with Flowbite.
- [⏳] Wiring up the API endpoints.
- [ ] Final touches on data validation.
