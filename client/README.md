# Coding
1. create a component named 'Enquiry'
2. install 'flowbite' for ui components
- after installation, we use components like below

3. Created a component named "Enquiry", inside that I created a form which takes some info from user, 
2. inside "Enquiry" component itself, I have added the EnquiryTable component, which is created separately in another folder and imported here

## NOTE: then we created our server, and models and now back to here
- install package axios
